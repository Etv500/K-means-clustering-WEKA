A simple exercise in which K-means clustering (WEKA) is applied to a data set. Report and dataset attached. 
You can get your WEKA .here: https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/downloading_weka/. K-means clustering is simply run multiple times while changing k and seed to optimize the clustering. For simplicity only the optimal model has been attached. Dataset attached. Remember you can import this model in WEKA from the 'cluster' tab.
